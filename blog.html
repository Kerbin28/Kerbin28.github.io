<h2>Hello Internet! (2021-02-23)</h2>
    <p>Right now its around 1am on a monday night. I've just finished my first hackathon over the weekend and I have a midterm
        tomorrow and the following day. Probably a bad time to start making a website but what's done is done! I really have no idea what I'm expecting
        going into this, probably woefully unprepared with only basic HTML and CSS that I've learned in grade 9, and with no knowledge of
        javascript, SQL, PHP, etc. Hopefully I'll organize everything on this website soon, along with some more convenient way of accessing any blog posts I'll make in the
        future. Hopefully I'll figure out js one day and learn how to bring life this site. Hopefully I'll find a coop job. Hopefully I'll stop typing "Hopefully". The future is
        still uncertain with the pandemic, but we'll get out of it one day.
    </p>
